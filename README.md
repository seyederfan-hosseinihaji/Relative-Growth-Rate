# Relative-Growth-Rate

These simple lines of code are designed to calculate the Relative Growth Rate (RGR). To perform this calculation, the initial and final dry weights of the plant, along with a defined time period, are required.

## **Features:**

\
This program calculates the Relative Growth Rate (RGR) using the natural logarithm formula. It then evaluates whether growth has occurred through Boolean logic (`isTRUE()`). Finally, a summary report is displayed in the console.

## Example Input

**Initial plant dry weight (w1, in grams)**

**Final plant dry weight (w2, in grams)**

**Starting day (t1, in days)** – the first day of measurement.

**Ending day (t2, in days)** – the last day of measurement.
